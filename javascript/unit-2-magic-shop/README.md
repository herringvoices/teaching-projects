# Bubblegum Sparkle's Magic Emporium

## Unit 2: Debugging, Functions, and Data Organization

Welcome to **Bubblegum Sparkle's Magic Emporium** project!

In this project, you'll help the legendary (and slightly frazzled) Bubblegum Sparkle fix her magical shop website. Starting with broken code and mysterious bugs, you'll learn essential debugging skills, master function extraction, organize data effectively, and understand how code flows through complex applications—all while getting her enchanted merchandise back online!

- Debugging techniques and error analysis
- Reading and fixing existing code
- String manipulation and data validation
- Understanding and handling NaN (Not a Number)
