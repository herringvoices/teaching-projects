# League of (Somewhat) Super Heroes

## Unit 1: Building Arrays, Objects, and Loops (Supplemental Curriculum)

Welcome to the *League of (Somewhat) Super Heroes* project!

In this project, you'll start from simple string manipulation and gradually build a complete registration tool for an ever-growing league of heroes. Along the way, you'll master JavaScript basics, arrays, objects, loops, dynamic HTML, and how to connect data together using nested iteration—all skills you’ll need for real web apps and (eventually) React.

### **What You’ll Learn**

- Writing and calling functions
- String interpolation with template literals
- Manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
- Creating and managing arrays
- Building objects and using object properties
- Using loops (`for...of`) to process arrays
- Connecting user input to dynamic data
- Using nested loops to match up related data (like heroes and cities)
- Debugging and reasoning through errors
