# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures – Multi‑Unit Curriculum

This repository contains three themed project units that progressively build core JavaScript and early data modeling skills. Each unit stands alone narratively while reinforcing and extending prior technical concepts.

Use the table below to jump directly to any chapter. Rows represent chapter numbers; columns represent units. Empty cells mean that unit has fewer chapters than another.

## Unit Focus Summaries

| Unit | Focus Highlights |
|------|------------------|
| 1 | Foundational JS: strings, arrays, objects, loops, DOM basics, nested iteration. |
| 2 | Debugging, refactoring, modularization, separating data from logic, reading diagrams. |
| 3 | Data modeling (ERDs, join tables), array transforms, event handling, simple UI state. |

---

## Suggested Progression

1. Complete Unit 1 for baseline JS fluency.
2. Move to Unit 2 to sharpen debugging and modular thinking.
3. Advance to Unit 3 to connect data relationships with interactive UI patterns.

Feel free to revisit earlier units if later chapters reveal gaps in your knowledge.

## Navigation Tips

- Each unit has its own `README` with context and pacing guidance.
- Chapters sometimes include "Next" / "Previous" links at the bottom; use the table above for quick jumps.
- Keep notes (and redraw ERDs) as relationships evolve—externalizing thinking speeds learning.

Enjoy the journey—steady iteration beats large leaps. Happy coding!
